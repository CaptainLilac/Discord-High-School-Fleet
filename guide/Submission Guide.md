# Auto Playlist Submission Guide

## What's acceptable?

From most to least

1) Anime OP's and ED's
2) General Japanese Music (music should have Japanese lyrics)
3) Anime OP and ED remixes (but not meme remixes, radio's hold final say if the remix is too meme-y)
4) Anime OST

## How should my submission be formatted?

Like so! Note the double line spacing.

```
